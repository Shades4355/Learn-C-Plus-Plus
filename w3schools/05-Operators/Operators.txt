Arithmetic:
+	  Addition	Adds together two values	              x + y
-	  Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	    x - y
*	  Multiplication	Multiplies two values	            x * y
/	  Division	Divides one value by another	          x / y
%   Modulus	Returns the division remainder	          x % y
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

Assignment:
=	    x = 5	    x = 5
+=  	x += 3	  x = x + 3
-=  	x -= 3	  x = x - 3
*=  	x *= 3  	x = x * 3
/=  	x /= 3  	x = x / 3
%=  	x %= 3  	x = x % 3
&=  	x &= 3  	x = x & 3
|=  	x |= 3  	x = x | 3
^=  	x ^= 3  	x = x ^ 3
>>=  	x >>= 3  	x = x >> 3
<<=  	x <<= 3  	x = x << 3

Comparison:
==	Equal to	                x == y
!=	Not equal	                x != y
>	  Greater than	            x > y
<	  Less than	                x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	    x <= y

Logical:
&&
  Logical and
  Returns true if both statements are true
  ex: x < 5 &&  x < 10

||
  Logical or
  Returns true if one of the statements is true
  ex: x < 5 || x < 4

!
  Logical not
  Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true
  ex: !(x < 5 && x < 10)
